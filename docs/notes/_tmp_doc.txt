 Load Utilization FrameworkSpace-Based Metric for 53' Step Deck Trailers1. OverviewThis framework defines how to measure load utilization for COT shipments. The primary metric is Space Utilization - the percentage of trailer capacity consumed by loaded products, accounting for both horizontal (length) and vertical (stacking) efficiency.Key principles:Each position on the trailer consumes length based on the longest product in that positionFull stacks receive full credit; partial stacks are penalized proportionallyMixed products can share a position and combine to fill vertical spaceFigure 1: Examples of fully loaded COT trailers showing stacked products2. Trailer Specifications2.1 Trailer TypesCOT primarily uses 53' step deck trailers for shipping. Alternative trailer types include:Step Deck (Primary): Two-level loading surface with 10' upper deck and 43' lower deck. Used for most USA, UTA, and DUMP shipments.Flatbed: Single-level 53' loading surface. May be used when step deck is unavailable or for specific product configurations.Wedge Trailer: Specialized trailer automatically used for Equipment (HDEQ) category units. Features angled design for loading heavy equipment.Figure 2: 53' Step Deck Trailer SpecificationsFigure 3: Standard 53' Flatbed TrailerFigure 4: Wedge Trailer (used for Equipment category)2.2 Step Deck Loading ZonesThe step deck trailer has two distinct loading zones with physical constraints that must be considered:ZoneLengthProduct ConstraintNotesUpper Deck10'Length ≤ 10' ONLYSmaller products onlyLower Deck43'All productsMain loading areaTotal53'—Combined for utilization calculation3. Physical Capacity CheckBefore calculating utilization percentage, verify the load physically fits on the trailer.3.1 Capacity Check ProcessClassify each product: Length ≤ 10' can use either deck; Length &gt; 10' is lower deck onlyCalculate lower deck requirement: Sum of (Positions × Length) for all products that MUST go on lower deckCheck lower deck fit: If lower deck requirement &gt; 43', load exceeds capacityAllocate remaining space: Small products (≤10') can overflow to upper deck if lower deck is full3.2 Positions Available by Product LengthProduct LengthLower Deck (43')Upper Deck (10')Max Positions7'6 positions1 position710'4 positions1 position512'3 positions—316'2 positions—220'2 positions—222'1 position—125'+1 position—14. Utilization Calculation4.1 Position Credit CalculationEach position's credit depends on how fully the vertical stack is utilized:Position Credit = (Vertical Fill %) × (Length / 53')Where:Vertical Fill % = Units in Position / Max Stack Height for that positionLength = Length with Tongue of the longest product in the position4.2 Full Stack vs. Partial StackFull stack (100% fill): Full credit → Length / 53'Partial stack: Penalized → (Units / Max Stack) × (Length / 53')4.3 Mixed Product PositionsDifferent products can share a position to maximize vertical fill:Combine vertical fill percentages from each productUse the longest product's length as the position footprintCap total vertical fill at 100%4.4 Total Load UtilizationLoad Utilization = Σ (Position Credits)5.

Worked ExamplesExample 1: Single Product with Partial StackLoad: 17× 5X8GW2K (Length: 7', Max Stack: 6)Capacity Check: 7' products can use upper deck. Need 3 positions × 7' = 21'. Lower deck (43') + upper deck (10') = 53' available. ✓ FITSPositionUnitsFill %LengthCredit166/6 = 100%7'7' × 100% = 7.0'266/6 = 100%7'7' × 100% = 7.0'3 (partial)55/6 = 83%7'7' × 83% = 5.8'TOTAL1719.8'Utilization = 19.8' / 53' = 37.4% → Grade FExample 2: Mixed Products Completing a StackLoad: 15× 5X8GW2K (7', stack 6) + 1× 6X12DUMP (16', stack 3)Capacity Check: DUMP at 16' requires lower deck. SA at 7' can use either. Total lower deck need: 16' (mixed position) + 14' (2× SA stacks) = 30' &lt; 43'. ✓ FITSThe 15 SAs fill 2 full stacks (12 units) with 3 remaining. The DUMP can stack with the partial SA stack since 3/6 + 1/3 ≈ 83% vertical fill. Use DUMP's longer length (16') for that position.PositionContentsFill %LengthCredit16× SA6/6 = 100%7'7.0'26× SA6/6 = 100%7'7.0'3 (mixed)3× SA + 1× DUMP3/6 + 1/3 = 83%16'16' × 83% = 13.3'TOTAL16 units27.3'Utilization = 27.3' / 53' = 51.5% → Grade DExample 3: Perfect Mixed Stack (Full Vertical Fill)Load: 15× 5X8GW2K (7', stack 6) + 2× 6X12DUMP (16', stack 3)Capacity Check: Same logic as Example 2. ✓ FITSSame as above, but with 2 DUMPs.

Position 1: 20' → 23' remaining. Position 2: 20' → 3' remaining. Position 3: Needs 20' but only 3' available, and 20' &gt; 10' so cannot use upper deck. ✗ EXCEEDS CAPACITYPositionUnitsFill %LengthCredit155/5 = 100%20'20.0'255/5 = 100%20'20.0'3 (won't fit)1—20'N/AMAX FIT1040.0'Maximum capacity: 10 units (2 full stacks)Utilization at max: 40.0' / 53' = 75.5% → Grade BKey insight: Even though 75.5% &lt; 100%, this load is at physical capacity due to deck constraints. The 11th unit must go on a second truck. This is why capacity check must happen BEFORE utilization calculation.Example 5: Well-Optimized Mixed LoadLoad: 24× 5X8GW2K (7', stack 6) + 10× 6X12GW (16', stack 5)Capacity Check: 6X12 at 16' requires lower deck: 2 positions × 16' = 32'. 5X8 at 7' needs 4 positions × 7' = 28'. Total = 60' &gt; 53'. ✗ EXCEEDS CAPACITYThis load would need to be split across two trucks.7.
